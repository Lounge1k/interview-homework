# Warehouse Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a warehouse application that enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for warehouse products. The system is comprised of two main components:

1. A client-side application built with TypeScript using the Angular framework
2. A server-side application developed in JavaScript using the Express framework

Both the server and client applications must be running concurrently for the system to function properly.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the server-side application
- `frontend/`: Contains the client-side application

## Installation and Setup

### Backend

For detailed instructions on installing and running the backend application, please refer to the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

For detailed instructions on installing and running the frontend application, please refer to the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

## Usage

Ensure both the backend and frontend applications are running simultaneously to use the Warehouse Management System.

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements could be implemented in future iterations:

1. Implement pagination to handle large numbers of products efficiently
2. Enhance error handling and display user-friendly error messages for server connectivity issues
3. Develop a mobile-responsive version of the application
4. Implement a design system for consistent colors, spacing, and typography, or integrate an existing one
5. Create a single command script to launch both frontend and backend applications simultaneously

## Criteria

- **Code design and architecture** - Is the architecture of application clear? Does it use patterns that helps with maintainability and scalability?
- **Code quality**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand?
- **Functionality**: Does the application work as expected?
- **Performance**: Does the application run effiecently?
- **Testing**: Are there unit and integration tests? Do they test the functionality?
- **Documentation**: Are we able to run project following instructions in README? Is the code documented?

If time prioritization is necessary, criteria should not be sacrificed; rather, completeness should be.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your work!
