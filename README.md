# Interview Homework

## Overview

A warehouse application where it is possible to add, read, update and delete warehouse products.

Consists of two parts: 

1. Client side application written in typescript on Angular framework 
2. Server side application written in javascript on express framework.

Both of server and client should be running at the same time for application to work normally.

For running and installing the parts refore to the documentation below

## Backend

The `backend/` folder contains the server application. Please refer to [README](./backend/README.md) for installation and running installation.

## Frontend

The `frontend/` folder contains the server application. Please refer to [README](./frontend/README.md) for installation and running installation.

## Possible improvements

* Adding a pagintaion so in case of many products loading simultaniusly application doesn't crash
* Erorr handling and error messages when server is not responding
* Mobile version
* Implementing design system for colors/spacing/typography or using existing one
* A script to run both FE and BE from one command

## Criteria

- **Code design and architecture** - Is the architecture of application clear? Does it use patterns that helps with maintainability and scalability?
- **Code quality**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand?
- **Functionality**: Does the application work as expected?
- **Performance**: Does the application run effiecently?
- **Testing**: Are there unit and integration tests? Do they test the functionality?
- **Documentation**: Are we able to run project following instructions in README? Is the code documented?

If time prioritization is necessary, criteria should not be sacrificed; rather, completeness should be.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your work!
